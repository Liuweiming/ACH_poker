// Bots are things which can play a game. Here we define the interface for
// various features of a bot, and some trivial uniform and fixed action bots.

// Different use-cases include:
// - play a bot versus another bot (we just need an action). This should be
//   general enough to support simultaneous games (in which case the bot needs
//   to know a player_id).
// - restart the game (to the initial state, and an arbitrary state)
// - interact with a bot and study its behavior, for example by looking at its
//   policy in specific states, or by accessing its action distribution. This
//   implies being able to set the bot into a specific game state.

// Bots can differ, in particular with respect to:
//
// 1. Bot determinism.
//    - deterministic: the (state -> action) suggestion is deterministic
//    - Explicit Stochastic: the (state-> distribution over actions) is
//      deterministic and the bot exposes it
//    - Implicitly stochastic: even though the (state -> actions distribution)
//      may exist in theory, it's intractable or not implemented. Thus, the
//      (state -> action) suggestion is stochastic.
//
// 2. Bot statefulness. A bot can be stateless, or stateful (the policy can
//    depend on the history of states, observations and/or actions).

namespace open_spiel {

// A simple bot that can play moves and be restarted. The bot may be stateful,
// thus, one should restart it to provide states from a different history line.
//
// For simulatenous games, or for bots playing as a single player, the
// implementation should take the player_id in the constructor.
//
// Optionally, the Bot can provide additional functionality (see
// `IsOverridable` and `ProvidesPolicy`).
// In Python, the simplest way to implement such a bot is:
//
// class MyBot(pyspiel.Bot):
//
//  def __init__(self):
//    pyspiel.Bot.__init__(self)
//    # If you do implement get_policy and step_with_policy
//  def provides_force_action(self):
//    return True
//  def force_action(self, state, action):
//    ...
