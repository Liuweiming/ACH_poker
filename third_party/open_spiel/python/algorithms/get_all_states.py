  """Gets all states in the game, indexed by their string representation.

  For small games only! Useful for methods that solve the  games explicitly,
  i.e. value iteration. Use this default implementation with caution as it does
  a recursive tree walk of the game and could easily fill up memory for larger
  games or games with long horizons.

  Currently only works for sequential games.

  Arguments:
    game: The game to analyze, as returned by `load_game`.
    depth_limit: How deeply to analyze the game tree. Negative means no limit, 0
      means root-only, etc.
    include_terminals: If True, include terminal states.
    include_chance_states: If True, include chance node states.
    to_string: The serialization function. We expect this to be
      `lambda s: s.history_str()` as this enforces perfect recall, but for
        historical reasons, using `str` is also supported, but the goal is to
        remove this argument.
    stop_if_encountered: if this is set, do not keep recursively adding states
      if this state is already in the list. This allows support for games that
      have cycles.

  Returns:
    A `dict` with `to_string(state)` keys and `pyspiel.State` values containing
    all states encountered traversing the game tree up to the specified depth.
