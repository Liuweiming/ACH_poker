  """Implements the Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR-BR) algorithm.

  This is Counterfactual Regret Minimization against Best Response, from
  Michael Johanson and al., 2012, Finding Optimal Abstract Strategies in
  Extensive-Form Games,
  https://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/publications/AAAI12-cfrbr.pdf).

  The algorithm
  computes an approximate Nash policy for n-player zero-sum games, but the
  implementation is currently restricted to 2-player.

  It uses an exact Best Response and full tree traversal.

  One iteration for a n-player game consists of the following:

  - Compute the BR of each player against the rest of the players.
  - Then, for each player p sequentially (from player 0 to N-1):
    - Compute the conterfactual reach probabilities and action values for player
      p, playing against the set of the BR for all other players.
    - Update the player `p` policy using these values.

  CFR-BR should converge with high probability (see the paper), but we can also
  compute the time-averaged strategy.

  The implementation reuses the `action_values_vs_best_response` module and
  thus uses TabularPolicies. This will run only for smallish games.
