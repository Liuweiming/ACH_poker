  Attributes:
    weighted_action_values: A dictionary mapping (player,information state
      string) to a dictionary mapping each action to a vector of the sum of
      (reward * prob) reward taking that action for each player. To get the
      action-values, one will need to normalize by `info_state_prob`.
    info_state_prob:  A dictionary mapping (player,information state string) to
      the reach probability of this info_state.
    info_state_player_prob: Same as info_state_prob for the player reach
      probability.
    info_state_cf_prob: Same as info_state_prob for the counterfactual reach
      probability to get to that state, i.e. the sum over histories, of the
      product of the opponents probabilities of actions leading to the history.
    info_state_chance_prob: Same as above, for the chance probability to get
      into that state.
    info_state_cf_prob_by_q_sum: A dictionary mapping (player,information state
      string) to a vector of shape `[num_actions]`, that store for each action
      the cumulative \sum_{h \in x} cfr_reach(h) * Q(h, a)
    root_values: The values at the root node [for player 0, for player 1].
