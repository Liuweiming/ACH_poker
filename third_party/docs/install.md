# Installation

The instructions here are for Linux and MacOS. For installation on Windows, see
[these separate installation instructions](windows.md).

Currently there are two installation methods:

1.  building from the source code and editing `PYTHONPATH`.
2.  using `pip install` to build and testing using
    [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/). A pip package to install directly
    does not exist yet.
3.  installing via [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

## Summary

In a nutshell:

```bash
./install.sh  # Needed to run once and when major changes are released.
./build_and_run_tests.sh  # Run this every-time you need to rebuild.
```

1.  Install system packages (e.g. cmake) and download some dependencies. Only
    needs to be run once or if you enable some new conditional dependencies (see
    specific section below).

    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

2.  Install your Python dependencies, e.g. in Python 3 using
    [`virtualenv`](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/):

    ```bash
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Use `deactivate` to quit the virtual environment.

    `pip` should be installed once and upgraded:

    ```
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    # Install pip deps as your user. Do not use the system's pip.
    python3 get-pip.py
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install --upgrade setuptools testresources
    ```

3.  This sections differs depending on the installation procedure:

    **Building and testing from source**

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ./open_spiel/scripts/build_and_run_tests.sh
    ```

    **Building and testing using PIP**

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install .
    pip install nox
    nox -s tests
    ```

    Optionally, use `pip install -e` to install in
    [editable mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs),
    which will allow you to skip this `pip install` step if you edit any Python
    source files. If you edit any C++ files, you will have to rerun the install
    command.

4.  Only when building from source:

    ```bash
    # For the python modules in open_spiel.
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<path_to_open_spiel>
    # For the Python bindings of Pyspiel
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<path_to_open_spiel>/build/python
    ```

    to `./venv/bin/activate` or your `~/.bashrc` to be able to import OpenSpiel
    from anywhere.

To make sure OpenSpiel works on the default configurations, we do use the
`python3` command and not `python` (which still defaults to Python 2 on modern
Linux versions).

## Installing via Docker

Option 1 (Basic, 3.13GB):

```bash
docker build --target base -t openspiel . --rm
```

Option 2 (Slim, 2.26GB):

```bash
docker build --target python-slim -t openspiel . --rm
```

If you are only interested in developing in Python, use the second image. You
can navigate through the runtime of the container (after the build step) with:

```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash openspiel
```

Finally you can run examples using:

```bash
docker run openspiel python3 python/examples/matrix_game_example.py
docker run openspiel python3 python/examples/example.py
```

## Running the first examples

In the `build` directory, running `examples/example` will prints out a list of
registered games and the usage. Now, letâ€™s play game of Tic-Tac-Toe with uniform
random players:

```bash
examples/example --game=tic_tac_toe
```

Once the proper Python paths are set, from the main directory (one above
`build`), try these out:

```bash
# Similar to the C++ example:
python3 open_spiel/python/examples/example.py --game=breakthrough

# Play a game against a random or MCTS bot:
python3 open_spiel/python/examples/mcts.py --game=tic_tac_toe --player1=human --player2=random
python3 open_spiel/python/examples/mcts.py --game=tic_tac_toe --player1=human --player2=mcts
```

## Detailed steps

### Configuration conditional dependencies

See `open_spiel/scripts/global_variables.sh` to configure the conditional
dependencies. See also the [Developer Guide](developer_guide.md).

### Installing system-wide dependencies

See `install.sh` for the required packages and cloned repositories.

### Installing Python dependencies

Using a `virtualenv` to install python dependencies is highly recommended. For
more information see:
[https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

Install dependencies (Python 3):

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, although not recommended, you can install the Python dependencies
system-wide with:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Building and running tests

Make sure that the virtual environment is still activated.

By default, Clang C++ compiler is used (and potentially installed by
`install.sh`).

Build and run tests (Python 3):

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
CXX=clang++ cmake -DPython_TARGET_VERSION=3.6 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${CXX} ../open_spiel
make -j$(nproc)
ctest -j$(nproc)
```

The CMake variable `Python_TARGET_VERSION` is used to specify a Python version.
Any Python library found with CMake modules FindPython2/FindPython3 that agrees
with the major version and is at least as high for minor version and patch
number is accepted. If the variable is not set, the FindPython module is used:
it builds for Python 3 if both Python 2 and Python 3 are available. In the two
examples above, CMake will search for Python 2 and accept any version >= 2.7 or
search for Python 3 and accept any version >= 3.6.

One can run an example of a game running (in the `build/` folder):

```bash
./examples/example --game=tic_tac_toe
```

### Setting Your PYTHONPATH environment variable

To be able to import the Python code (both the C++ binding `pyspiel` and the
rest) from any location, you will need to add to your PYTHONPATH the root
directory and the `open_spiel` directory.

When using a virtualenv, the following should be added to
`<virtualenv>/bin/activate`. For a system-wide install, ddd it in your `.bashrc`
or `.profile`.

```bash
# For the python modules in open_spiel.
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<path_to_open_spiel>
# For the Python bindings of Pyspiel
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<path_to_open_spiel>/build/python
```
