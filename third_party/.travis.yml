# For context, OpenSpiel is developed day-to-day using private continuous
# integration software.
#
# The current Travis CI setup is unpolished and verifies that open-source
# OpenSpiel builds correctly. This is done on a best-effort basis; we are not
# attached to Travis CI.
#
# If you use OpenSpiel, continuous integration improvements are welcome.
# Potential contributions include improving the CI configuration, using either
# Travis CI or another service (CircleCI, etc).
